                  Senior student adding an undergraduate MIS degree to a BSBA (Economics), MBA, JD. Working towards
                  graduation at the end of this semester. Self-employed as an attorney, project manager, business
                  analyst, and general business consultant for the last decade.

                  Hobbies are sparse, generally include working and learning new things for the job. Currently working
                  on starting a third business that is owned fully by myself (I own at least 15% of another four
